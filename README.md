## Introduction

### What is Spinal Degeneration?

Spinal degeneration refers to the breakdown of the spine's structural integrity, often leading to pain, reduced mobility, and other health issues. It is most commonly seen in the lumbar region due to its role in bearing the body's weight and providing flexibility.

### Relevant Classes for this Competition

1. **Normal**: No signs of degeneration.
2. **Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD)**: Thinning or drying of spinal discs.
3. **Spinal Stenosis**: Narrowing of the spinal canal, leading to nerve compression.
4. **Spondylolisthesis**: Forward slipping of one vertebra over another.
5. **Osteoarthritis**: Breakdown of cartilage between vertebrae.

### Visual Characteristics and Symptoms

1. **Normal**: 
   - **Visual**: Healthy disc space, no narrowing or bone spurs.
   - **Symptoms**: Typically asymptomatic.
  
2. **Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD)**: 
   - **Visual**: Reduced disc height, possible darkening on MRI.
   - **Symptoms**: Back pain, stiffness, possible radiating leg pain.
  
3. **Spinal Stenosis**: 
   - **Visual**: Narrowed spinal canal, thickened ligamentum flavum.
   - **Symptoms**: Pain, numbness, or weakness in legs; difficulty walking.
  
4. **Spondylolisthesis**: 
   - **Visual**: Misalignment of vertebrae, visible slippage.
   - **Symptoms**: Lower back pain, leg pain, muscle tightness.
  
5. **Osteoarthritis**: 
   - **Visual**: Bone spurs, joint space narrowing.
   - **Symptoms**: Pain, swelling, reduced range of motion.

### Additional Questions to Explore

- How does spinal degeneration progress over time?
- What demographic factors (age, gender, lifestyle) influence degeneration risk?
- How do MRI findings correlate with patient-reported symptoms?
- What are the potential treatment options for each class?
- How can machine learning models assist radiologists in diagnosis?

## Data

### Data Collection and Sources

- **MRI Images**: Obtain MRI scans from the Kaggle dataset, ensuring they are labeled with corresponding classes.
- **Annotations**: Look for datasets with expert annotations to validate model predictions.
- **Demographics**: Explore additional data on patient demographics if available to understand risk factors.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Normalization**: Ensure consistent image sizes and scales.
- **Augmentation**: Implement data augmentation techniques to increase training data variability.
- **Labeling**: Verify the accuracy of class labels and handle any inconsistencies.

### Questions to Address

- What is the size and distribution of the dataset across different classes?
- Are there any imbalances in class representation that need addressing?
- What preprocessing steps are necessary to prepare the data for modeling?
- How will you split the data into training, validation, and test sets?

## Methodology

### Model Selection

- Consider different neural network architectures suitable for image classification, such as CNNs or transfer learning models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).

### Evaluation Metrics

- Determine the metrics for model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- Consider the implications of false positives and false negatives in the medical context.

### Experimental Design

- Outline the approach for training and validating the model.
- Plan for hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
